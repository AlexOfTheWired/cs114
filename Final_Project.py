Final Project Proposal()
Create a cash register program.

- On initialize the user sets amount of Bills and Coins in register
      (starting bank amount)

- Set Sales Tax
      - sales_tax = 2.3%

- Then print Register status:
      - Amount of Coins and Bills
      - Total cash amount


Render Transaction:
    (Start with empty list... dictionary?)

- Input item price
    ( append price to list... dictionary?)
    transaction_0001 = {
                        'Item #1': 3.50,
                        'Item #2': 11.99,
                        'Item #3': 2.30,
                        'Item #4': 23.00
                        }

- Calculate Sub Total
    ( )

- Calculate balance due/TOTAL
    ( use sum() on item list items +  sales_tax)

- Input amount tendered
    ( input how much of each unit was given )

- Calculate change return
    - Coins
    - Bills

Print Receipt
    FORMAT EXAMPLE
======================================
        - ( STORE NAME ) -

      list             price
    ==========================
     - Item #1          $3.50
     - Item #2         $11.99
     - Item #3          $2.30
     - Item #4         $23.00
    --------------------------
     - Sub Total       $40.79
     - SALES TAX        $0.00

     - Total           $40.79
     - Cash            $50.00
     - CHANGE ===>      $9.23
    ==========================
     Transaction Number: 0001

=====================================

- Make function that stores transaction data for later use.

- Complete transaction
        (reset tranaction dictionary or start new tranaction list.)

- Record amount of coins and bills were exchanged after transaction.
    - how many coins and bills were taken out of register?
    - how many coins and bills were taken in after transaction?

Print Register status: (Audit Tally)
    - All Transactions
        ( Make function that stores transaction data? Transaction Class!
          Each transaction creates a new instance. )
      - Amount of Coins and Bills
      - Total cash amount

I can even make a GUI for this!
  !!!GUI IS A MUST NOW!!!


(Destroy Register)

Possible Bugs:
- register runs out of bills or coins
- customer pays in FUCKING PENNIES!!!
- change back requires (1 five, 4 singles, 2 dimes, 3 pennies).
  but register does not have any fives.
